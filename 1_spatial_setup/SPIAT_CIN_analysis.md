## Data preparation

X and y coordinates are converted from pixel to Âµm by the factor 0.325.


``` r
# max values x and y before conversion
max(df_all$Loc_X)
```

```
## [1] 2034
```

``` r
max(df_all$Loc_Y)
```

```
## [1] 2034
```

``` r
df_all <- df_all %>%
  mutate(Loc_X = Loc_X * 0.325,
         Loc_Y = Loc_Y * 0.325)

# max values x and y after conversion
max(df_all$Loc_X)
```

```
## [1] 661.05
```

``` r
max(df_all$Loc_Y)
```

```
## [1] 661.05
```

Combine ILCs A and ILC2s B into ILC2s


``` r
df_all$ref_markers <- gsub("CD127,CD45,CD90,KLRG1,Kappa,MHCII,GATA3eGFP", 
                           "CD127,CD45,CD90,KLRG1,GATA3eGFP", df_all$ref_markers)

                           "CD127,CD45,CD90,KLRG1,GATA3eGFP", df_all$ref_markers)

df_all$CellType <- gsub("NK cells/ILC1s", "NK cells & ILC1s", df_all$CellType)
```

Define markers, cell_types and reference:

## Cells in neighborhood analysis

The next chunk will take the radius and unit provided in the header of the document and loop through all the available datasets in the Dataset column of the df_all dataframe. It will create csv files containing all the frequencies of neighboring cells within the radius provided and save the files in the folder provided.
